## About this project
I want to go through the process of going through the BSA rank requirements. The primary motivations are to expand my knowledge of basic outdoor skills, and to organize my free time and energy into a larger project that lets me improve myself and help others.  

I explicitly do not want to have something to brag about, or to claim that I have earned any scouting rank. The goal is the experience, not the rank.  

## Going Solo

This project is primarily a personal and individual one; I don't plan to get involved in any youth BSA groups. 

Because scouting is organized as a group activity, I'll have to adapt some of the requirements while preserving their essential character.  

For example, a solo camping trip or hike can count as a "troop activity". For knowledge and skill requirements, I can demonstrate them using my own words in text, photos, a video clip,  etc.  

I acknowledge that the value of demonstrating knowledge and skills in a group setting comes from the opportunity for correction from someone more experienced. To avoid gaps due to ignorance, I will learn from at least two sources (e.g. handbook + 1 other source) for each item, and document what that source was.  

For requirements that are essentially tied to leadership, scouting or group activity, I can fill them by participating in other groups of adults where that is feasible, by doing something myself, or a combination of the two.  

Requirements that are simply more inconvenient for an individual adult still apply, to the greatest extent that accomplishing them is feasible. For example, participating in a group flag ceremony may be infeasible for an individual, but attending a flag ceremony is feasible, even if inconvenient.  

Infeasible requirements, or components or requirements, should be replaced with something that has comparable learning objectives or outcomes, and at least the same level of difficulty. For example, if I attend a flag ceremony but do not participate, I would additionally demonstrate my knowledge of the steps to preform a flag ceremony, such as by making a video.

As in scouting, nothing done before joining the troop counts. For me, nothing I've done before starting this project on April 7, 2022 counts.
