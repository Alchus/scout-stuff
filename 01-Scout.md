**Scout Oath**  
The Scout Oath is a commitment with three parts: to god and country, to others, and to oneself. The Scout commits to serve each to the best of his ability.

**Scout Law**  
The Scout Law is a list of twelve virtues that Scouts aim to uphold. Together, they outline a moral framework based off of virtue ethics.

**Scout Motto**  
 The motto, "Be prepared!" speaks both to the generally straightforward advice that planning and preparation are helpful to nearly all endeavors, as well as to the goal of Scouting as a youth organization to prepare youth for their adult life.

 **Scout Slogan**  
The Slogan, "Do a good turn daily," is a framework for putting the virtues Scout Law and Oath into practice in daily life to form a Scout's habits and character. While it is easiest to interpret the good turn as an act of helpfulness, it can be any act that deliberately demonstrates the values of the Oath and Law. A Scout should not simply do one good turn per day; he should look for opportunities each day.


```
1b. Explain what Scout spirit is. Describe some ways you have shown Scout spirit by practicing the Scout Oath, Scout Law, Scout motto, and Scout slogan.
```

Scout Spirit is living by the Scout Law, Oath, motto, and slogan in one's daily life.

*To do: focus on living with Scout Spirit*

```
1c. Demonstrate the Boy Scout sign, salute, and handshake. Explain when they should be used.
```

![Salute](./media/images/scout-1c-salute.jpg)  
![Handshake](./media/images/scout-1c-handshake.jpg)  

The Sign is used when reciting the Scout Oath or Law; or to signify a request for quiet attention from a group of scouts.

The Salute is used when honoring a flag, or similar ceremonial context, while in a Scout uniform.  

The handshake is used as a greeting between scouts, especially if both are in uniform.

*I anticipate that I will use these three gestures very rarely as a "Lone Wolf"*


```
1d. Describe the First Class Scout badge and tell what each part stands for. Explain the significance of the First Class Scout badge.
```
* ✅ 4/8/2022  

* The three points of the fleur-de-lis stand for the three parts of the Scout Oath.
* The eagle and shield stand for freedom and a Scout’s readiness to defend that freedom.
* The two stars on the badge symbolize truth and knowledge.
* The knot at the bottom of the scroll represents the Scout Slogan, “Do a Good Turn Daily”.
* The scroll bearing the Scout motto, “Be Prepared,” is turned up at the ends as a reminder that
a Scout smiles as he does his duty.

As an ensemble, these symbols represent the core principles of scouting.

```
1e. Repeat from memory the Outdoor Code. In your own words, explain what the Outdoor Code means to you.
```

[Video](./media/video/scout-1e.mp4)

* ✅ 4/8/2022  

The outdoor pledge is a framework for individuals to contribute to preserving the natural environment. It encompasses actions to protect the outdoors while enjoying them, considerate treatment of other people while outdoors, and efforts to actively conserve the outdoors that may extend beyond "leave no trace".

```
1f. Repeat from memory the Pledge of Allegiance. In your own words, explain its meaning.
```

* ✅ 4/7/2022  

[Recording](./media/audio/scout-2f.m4a)

The Pledge is an expression of support for the United States as a nation and its foremost emblem, the flag. It references several values that are tied to the US's aspirational national identity: justice, liberty, piety, and unity.

National unity, especially when focused by aspirational values, can be a good catalyst for encouraging cooperation and trust between strangers, which is good for human well-being. 

*However, the Pledge is substantively an article of propaganda, and it shows its age.*

```
2a. Describe how the Scouts in the troop provide its leadership.
```

* ✅ 4/8/2022  

Youth Scout troops are organized into patrols, each with a leader. The Troop as a whole is led largely by a Senior Patrol Leader and a council of the patrol leaders. Adults, including the Scoutmaster, oversee and assist.

*In a way, my experience may be a maximal case of a scout-led troop, yet perhaps vacuously so, as "leading" only myself does not involve the challenges of communication, collaboration, and organization that are a valuable part of the youth Scout leader's experience.*


```
2b. Describe the four steps of Boy Scout advancement.
```

* ✅ 4/8/2022 

  * Learn - Learn the material
  * Test - Demonstrate the requirement & get sign-off
  * Review - Complete a Board of Review
  * Recognition - Announcement to the troop of the rank advancement.

[Guide to Advancement (pdf)](https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/33088.pdf)

*While following this curriculum alone, I'll have to use my own judgement as to when I've completed a requirement. As a guideline, I'll ask myself "is my mastery of this knowledge or skill at the level that I could use it for my own benefit (or the benefit of others, as appropriate), and could I comfortably teach it to others?"*

*I don't plan to have anything formal as a review process, except perhaps having my dad (former assistant scoutmaster) and/or brother (Eagle Scout) look through it. Hopefully, these publicly-available checklist pages serve as a kind of self-documenting review process and enable anyone to understand what I'm doing.*

```
2c. Describe what the Boy Scout ranks are and how they are earned.
```

* ✅ 4/7/2022  

The BSA ranks are Scout, Tenderfoot, Second Class, First Class, Star, Life, and Eagle.

In youth Scouting groups, Scout ranks are earned by participating in troop activities, completing the requirements, getting sign-off from a leader, and for ranks above Scout, completing a board of review.

*In my individual project, I endeavor not to *earn* the ranks, but to gain the *experience*. However, to structure my efforts, I will use a similar approach of documenting my accomplishments.* 

```
2d. Describe what merit badges are and how they are earned.
```
* ✅ 4/9/2022  

Merit badges are emblems that recognize a scout's completion of a the requirements to demonstrate knowledge and skills for a specialized topic. In a Scout troop, merit badges requirements are signed-off by a merit badge counsellor, who can be anyone that is recognized by the scouting organization to have the appropriate skills to teach that specialized topic.  

*If I pursue merit badge requirements, I'll learn from multiple sources of information to gain some of the benefit of outside expertise that a merit badge counsellor would provide.*

```
3a. Explain the patrol method. Describe the types of patrols that are used in your troop.
```

* ✅ 4/8/2022  

In youth Scout troops, Scouts are grouped into patrols, often grouping scouts at similar stages of their journey in Scouting. Patrols are expected to establish small-group cohesion and shared responsibility.

In my individual experience, there is only one kind of patrol: me acting alone, or with ad-hoc groups of my friends and acquaintances.

```
3b. Become familiar with your patrol name, emblem, flag, and yell. Explain how these items create patrol spirit.
```

**Patrol Name**: Lone Wolf Patrol

**Emblem**:

**Flag**:

**Yell**: A wolf howl: "Ah-wooooooo!"

*Scout patrols are often named after animals, so "Lone Wolf" is a good fit. Cooper is my dog, so using his face as the emblem for a wolf seems an allowable stretch -- though given his personality and craving for human companionship, associating him with the phrase "Lone Wolf" brings a note of irony.* 


```
4a. Show how to tie a square knot, two half-hitches, and a taut-line hitch. Explain how each knot is used.
```

```
4b. Show the proper care of a rope by learning how to whip and fuse the ends of different kinds of rope.
```

```
5	Demonstrate your knowledge of pocketknife safety.
```
* ✅ 4/9/2022  

* Keep knives in good condition: sharp, rust-free, and with smooth folding and unfolding.  
* Before passing a knife to another person, fold it if possible. Otherwise, pinch the blade by the sides, with the cutting edge facing up and away from the palm, and offer it handle-first. The reciever should verbally confirm control of the knife before moving it, such as by simply saying "thank you."
* Avoid cutting towards any part of the body, especially fingers.
* Keep a safe distance from others while using a knife.
* Don't throw knives.

[Cyber Chip](https://www.scouting.org/training/youth-protection/cyber-chip/grades-9-12/)

*Since I'm an adult and am not interacting with youth, this material is not directly related to my scout experience, but it does help me understand the way scouting activities involving youth are organized. Additionally, BSA's youth protection policies are thorough and well-documented; understanding them allows me to follow, implement or advocate for similar policies if I ever do work with youth or youth organizations.*

```
7	Since joining the troop and while working on the Scout rank, participate in a Scoutmaster conference.
