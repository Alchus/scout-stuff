The Pledge is an expression of support for the United States as a nation and its foremost emblem, the flag. It references several values that are tied to the US's aspirational national identity: justice, liberty, piety, and unity.

National unity, especially when focused by aspirational values, can be a good catalyst for encouraging cooperation and trust between strangers, which is good for human well-being. 

However, the Pledge is substantively an article of propaganda, and it shows its age. Our Republic is composed of and led by fallible humans, and, in acknowledgement of that fact, I cannot sincerely pledge unconditional allegiance to it.

The BSA ranks are Scout, Tenderfoot, Second Class, First Class, Star, Life, and Eagle.

In youth Scouting groups, Scout ranks are earned by participating in troop activities, completing the requirements, getting sign-off from a leader, and for ranks above Scout, completing a board of review.

In my individual project, I endeavor not to *earn* the ranks, but to gain the *experience*. However, to structure my efforts, I will use a similar approach of documenting my accomplishments.
