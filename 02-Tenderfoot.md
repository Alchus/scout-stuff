**Poison Ivy**  
*Toxicodendron radicans*
 
 Poison ivy is a vine that secretes the irritant chemical urushiol, which can cause skin rashes. Poison ivy typically has three leaves, each in the shape of a pointed oval with several "thumbs."

**Poison Oak**  
*Toxicodendron diversilobum*
 
 Like poison ivy, poison oak secretes urushiol and can cause rashes. It also grows with leaves in clusters of three, and the leaves typically have "thumbs" that are more rounded than those of poison ivy.

**Poison Sumac**  
*Toxicodendron vernix*
 
 Like poison ivy and poison oak, poison oak secretes urushiol and can cause rashes. It has leaves with 7-13 leaflets, each in the shape of a smooth oval with a pointed tip; the color can vary by season.

**Treatment**

For all three of these plants, the primary treatment is to wash off the irritant compound from the skin with soap and water. 

Topical corticosteroids (e.g. Cortisone) can be used to treat the allergic contact dermatitis caused by urushiol exposure.

##	Hiking
```
5a	Explain the importance of the buddy system as it relates to your personal safety on outings and in your neighborhood. Use the buddy system while on a troop or patrol outing.
```

Hiking, espicially in back country, has some risk of injury. When hiking alone, I don't have anyone to assist or seek help if I am injured.

On April 10, I hiked in a group of 3; we stayed together as a group, in part to assist Alejandro with the difficult terrain.

```
5b	Explain what to do if you become lost on a hike or campout.
```

* **S**tay Calm  
* **T**hink - recall the route, consult map & compass
* **O**bserve - Look for footprints, landmarks, trail markers, etc.
* **P**lan - if moving on is a the best option, do so carefully to avoid getting further lost. Mark the path to allow backtracking.
```
5c	Explain the rules of safe hiking, both on the highway and cross-country, during the day and at night.
```
***Backcountry**
* Step carefully
* Watch for animals
* Have adequate water and other supplies
* Avoid crossing deep or fast-moving water
* Don't get lost

**Roads** 
* Walk so that you can see oncoming traffic
* Be visible at night with light clothing and a flashlight.
