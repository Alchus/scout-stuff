Hiking and swimming (in cold water!) at Greeter falls with Alejandro M, Maggie, Peter, and Idin (and of course Cooper).

Then I went camping at the Prentice Cooper primitive campsite and just barely got my tent set up before dark fell. I started a fire with some generous assistance from a splash of kerosene.

There was a lot of trash around the site, so I picked up two garbage bags of trash.
