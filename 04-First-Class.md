# First Class Rank Requirements

##	CAMPING and OUTDOOR ETHICS
```
1a	Since joining Boy Scouts, participate in 10 separate troop/patrol activities, at least six of which must be held outdoors. Of the outdoor activities, at least three must include overnight camping. These activities do not include troop or patrol meetings. On campouts, spend the night in a tent that you pitch or other structure that you help erect, such as a lean-to, snow cave, or tepee.

```
1b	Explain each of the principles of Tread Lightly! and tell how you practiced them on a campout or outing. This outing must be different from the ones used for Tenderfoot requirement 1c and Second Class requirement 1b.
```
##	COOKING
```
2a	Help plan a menu for one of the above campouts that includes at least one breakfast, one lunch, and one dinner and that requires cooking at least two of the meals. Tell how the menu includes the foods from MyPlate or the current USDA nutritional model and how it meets nutritional needs for the planned activity or campout.
```

* ✅ 5/15/2022

*For the Blue Ridge, GA campout:*
| Breakfast |
|---|
| Pancakes, Eggs, Bacon |


| Lunch |
|---|
| Hot Dogs and Brats |

| Dinner |
|---|
| Fajita Tacos |


This menu has foods that are high in protein, making them a good source of energy for an active weekend outdoors. The fajita tacos include a lot of vegetables. *However, the bacon and brats are very high-fat meats, making them a delicious but treacherously easy way to oversupply calories*


```
2b	Using the menu planned in First Class requirement 2a, make a list showing a budget and the food amounts needed to feed three or more boys. Secure the ingredients.
```

```

```
2e	On one campout, serve as cook. Supervise your assistant(s) in using a stove or building a cooking fire. Prepare the breakfast, lunch, and dinner planned in First Class requirement 2a. Supervise the cleanup.
```

```

##	NAVIGATION
```
4a	Using a map and compass, complete an orienteering course that covers at least one mile and requires measuring the height and/or width of designated items (tree, tower, canyon, ditch, etc.)
```

* ✅ 6/04/2022 

I completed the permanent course at Red Top Mountain state park in 1 hour, 13 minutes.

As far as I can tell, measuring objects is not part of most orienteering courses. Instead I measured the length of the course, which I estimate to be 2,200 meters.

*This was surprisingly fun! The course got more challenging as it went, and I missed markers 8 and 10 and had to backtrack to find them.*

```
4b	Demonstrate how to use a handheld GPS unit, GPS app on a smartphone or other electronic navigation system. Use a GPS to find your current location, a destination of your choice, and the route you will take to get there. Follow that route to arrive at your destination.
```

##	NATURE
```
5a	Identify or show evidence of at least 10 kinds of native plants found in your local area or campsite location. You may show evidence by identifying fallen leaves or fallen fruit that you find in the field, or as part of a collection you have made, or by photographs you have taken.
```

```
5b	Identify two ways to obtain a weather forecast for an upcoming activity. Explain why weather forecasts are important when planning for an event.
```

```
5c	Describe at least three natural indicators of impending hazardous weather, the potential dangerous events that might result from such weather conditions, and the appropriate actions to take.
```

```
5d	Describe extreme weather conditions you might encounter in the outdoors in your local geographic area. Discuss how you would determine ahead of time the potential risk of these types of weather dangers, alternative planning considerations to avoid such risks, and how you would prepare for and respond to those weather conditions.
```

##	AQUATICS
```
6a	Successfully complete the BSA swimmer test.
```

* ✅ 5/28/2022 

Completed while swimming with Alejandro at Red Bank public pool.


```
6b	Tell what precautions must be taken for a safe trip afloat.
```

```
6c	Identify the basic parts of a canoe, kayak, or other boat. Identify the parts of a paddle or an oar.
```
* ✅ 7/22/2022 

![](./media/images/first-class-6c-kayak.jpg)

```
6d	Describe proper body positioning in a watercraft, depending on the type and size of the vessel. Explain the importance of proper body position in the boat.
```

* ✅ 7/22/2022 
 
 In all paddled watercraft, keep your center of gravity low and don't lean too far to either side. This reduces the risk of falling overboard and/or capsizing.

 In a canoe or kayak, sit or kneel facing forward. If only one person is paddling, they should be in the rear, to make steering easier.

 In a rowboat, sit facing backwards. This enables rowing by pulling the oar, which is more efficient than pushing.


```
6e	With a helper and a practice victim, show a line rescue both as tender and rescuer. 
(The practice victim should be approximately 30 feet from shore in deep water.)
```

##	FIRST AID AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS

	Transport a person from a smoke-filled room
	Transport for at least 25 yards a person with a sprained ankle.
```

```
7c	Tell the five most common signals of a heart attack.
    Explain the steps (procedures) in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
```

```
7d	Tell what utility services exist in your home or meeting place. Describe potential hazards associated with these utilities, and tell how to respond in emergency situations.
```

```
7e	Develop an emergency action plan for your home that includes what to do in case of fire, storm, power outage, and water outage.
```

```
7f	Explain how to obtain potable water in an emergency.
```

##	FITNESS

```

* ✅ 8/08/2022 

See [this log sheet](./physical-activity/First-Class.md)


```
8b	Share your challenges and successes in completing First Class requirement 8a. Set a goal for continuing to include physical activity as part of your daily life.
```

##	CITIZENSHIP

```

```
9b	Investigate an environmental issue affecting your community. Share what you learned about that issue with your patrol or troop. Tell what, if anything, could be done by you or your community to address the concern.
```

* ✅ 6/04/2022 

I discussed the city of Chattanooga's recycling program with the director of Green Steps, a local environmental nonprofit. I learned that most of the city's mixed-stream recycling is sent directly to the landfill, and the city pays more money per-ton of waste to process recyclables, despite them ending up in the same place.

Green Steps is involved in a project to raise awareness about the inefficacy of single-stream recycling and to encourage people to separate cans and bottles (which can be recycled) from all other plastics, which aren't recycled.

```
9c	On a Scouting or family outing, take note of the trash and garbage you produce. Before your next similar outing, decide how you can reduce, recycle, or repurpose what you take on that outing, and then put those plans into action. Compare your results.
```

* ✅ 6/1/2022 

![](./media/images/first-class-9c-before.jpg)

This isn't a huge amount of trash for 3 people on a day hike, but the bottles and cans are unnecessary. On my next trips, I'll stick to gatorade powder rather than canned drinks.

![](./media/images/first-class-9c-after.jpg)

On the second weekend in a row climbing, I had less trash to pack out. I didn't take any canned or bottled drinks.


```
9d	Participate in three hours of service through one or more service projects approved by your Scoutmaster. The project(s) must not be the same service project(s) used for Tenderfoot requirement 7b and Second Class requirement 8e. Explain how your service to others relates to the Scout Law.
```

- Cemetary flags (1.5 hours)

##	LEADERSHIP
```
10	Tell someone who is eligible to join Boy Scouts, or an inactive Boy Scout, about your Scouting activities. Invite him to an outing, activity, service project or meeting. Tell him how to join, or encourage the inactive Boy Scout to become active. Share your efforts with your Scoutmaster or other adult leader.
```
* ✅ 5/28/2022 

I discussed this project with Alejandro R on 5/28. He has previously come on a service project with me: the creek cleanup. He seemed unenthusiastic about the prospect of taking a project like this himself.

##	SCOUT SPIRIT
```
11	Demonstrate scout spirit by living the Scout Oath and Scout Law. Tell how you have done your duty to God and how you have lived four different points of the Scout Law (different from those points used for previous ranks) in your everyday life.
```

```
12	While working toward the First Class rank, and after completing Second Class requirement 11, participate in a Scoutmaster conference.
```

```
13	Successfully complete your board of review for the First Class rank.
```
